# Restaurant Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project analyses restaurant data to improve operations, customer satisfaction, and profitability. It demonstrates fundamental data analysis techniques using Python.

### Problem Statement
Restaurants generate large amounts of data but often don't have the tools or expertise to analyze it effectively. Key challenges include:
- Understanding customer preferences and ordering patterns
- Identifying most/least profitable menu items
- Optimizing staff scheduling based on busy periods
- Tracking sales trends and employee performance over time

### Goals
1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on restaurant transaction data
2. Identify top-selling and least-selling menu items
3. Analyze sales trends by time of day, day of week, and seasonality
4. Calculate key performance metrics (average order value, customer frequency)
5. Provide actionable recommendations for restaurant improvement

## Methods

### Data Sources
- Sample datasets will include:
  - Transaction records (date, time, order items, total amount)
  - Menu items with categories and costs
  - Customer information (optional)
  - Staff schedules (optional)

### Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis
- CSV/Excel for sample data storage

### Analysis Approach
1. Data cleaning and preparation
2. Descriptive statistics
3. Visualization of key metrics
4. Time series analysis
5. Menu item performance analysis
